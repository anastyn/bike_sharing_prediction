A simple neural network (with a single hidden layer) that estimates the number of bikes which are going to be rented next year based on the historical information from the previous years.
The forward and back propagation steps are implemented with NumPy without using any deep learning frameworks.

The dataset is too small to get a meaningful prediction, but it was a good exercise to get familiar with neural nets.
